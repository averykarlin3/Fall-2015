\section{Heine-Borel Theorem and Domain Properties}

\subsection{Heine-Borel Theorem}
Let K be a compact set in $\mathbb{R^d}$, and let ${U_\lambda | \lambda \in \Lambda}$ be a family of open sets in $\mathbb{R^d}$, which covers K, such that $K \subseteq \cup_{x \in \Lambda}U_\lambda$. Then $\exists \lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3 \text{... such that} K \subseteq U_{\lambda_1} \cup U_{\lambda_2} \cup \text{...} \cup U_{\lambda_n}.$

\subsubsection{Proof}
Since K is bounded, it can be fully contained within some rectangle (R), which can then be split into 4 congruent parts, $R_{i_1} (R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4)$. Suppose one quadrant cannot be covered by any finite collection of $U_\lambda$. By extension, if that quadrant is divided further, one of the subquadrants ($R_{i_1i_2}$) cannot be covered. This can continue for countable infinity divisions (able to be counted with an infinite amount of integer). Since $R_{i_1i_2...i_n} \neq \emptyset$, let $P_n$ be any point in $K \cap R_{i_1i_2...i_n}$, such that there is a bounded sequence of points in K. Thus it must have a convergent subsequence such that $P_{n_k} \to P, P \in K$. Thus, $P \in U_{\lambda^*}$ for some $\lambda^* \in \Lambda$. Since $U_{\lambda^*}$ is open, $\exists r > 0, \text{such that} B_r(P) \subseteq U_{\lambda^*}$. Diameter/diagonal length (diam) of $ R_{i_1i_2...i_n} = \frac{diam(R)}{2^n} < r$ as $n \to \infty$. Thus, $R_{i_1i_2...i_n} \subseteq B_r(P)$ as $n_k \to \infty$. $dist(P, P_{n_k}) < \frac{r}{2}$ and $dist(P_{n_k}, x) \leq diam(R_{i_1i_2...i_n})$ and by the triangle inequality, $diam(R_{i_1i_2...i_n}) < \frac{r}{2}$. Thus, there is a contradiction, and it must be covered by a finite number of sets.

\subsection{Uniform Continuity}
Let $f: D \to \mathbb{R}$, where $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$. We say $f$ is
uniformally continuous on $D$ if:
$$\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists+\delta > 0: \forall \vec{x}, \vec{y} \in D,
||+\vec{x} - \vec{y}+|| < \delta \to |f(\vec{x}) - f(\vec{y})| < \epsilon$$

The difference between this and regular continuity is that the $\delta$ in
regular continuity is defined by both $\epsilon$ and the specific point we
are considering. Uniform continuity, however, the value $\delta$ is independent
to the point you chose within the domain and is just dependent on $\epsilon$.

For example, consider $y = \tan{x}$ where $D = (-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})$.
the value required for $\delta$ for a fixed $\epsilon$ gets smaller and
smaller as $x$ approaches both endpoints. This function is continuous but not
uniformally so. If it were uniformally continuous,
that $\delta$ value would NOT change.

\underline{Theorem}: If $f$ is uniformally continuous on $D$, then $f$ is continuous
for every point in $D$.

\subsection{Uniform Continuity Theorem}
\underline{Theorem:}
If $f: K \to \mathbb{R}$, where $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ is compact, and
$f$ is continuous at each $\vec{x} \in K$. Then $f$ is uniformally continuous on
$K$.

\underline{Proof:}
Fix $\epsilon > 0$. For each $\vec{x} \in K$, let $u_{\vec{x}}$ be an open ball, centered at
$\vec{x}$ such that for any $\vec{y} \in K \cap 2u_{\vec{x}}$ [$2u_{\vec{x}}$ is
an open ball centered at $\vec{x}$ with twice the radius of $u_{\vec{x}}$], $|f(\vec{x}) -
f(\vec{y})| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$. Because the function is continuous at
$\vec{x}$, there is a radius $2\delta$ around $\vec{x}$ such that $|f(\vec{x}) -
f(\vec{y})| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$. Now we see that every $\vec{x} \in K$ is
covered by at least one such open ball, namely $u_{\vec{x}}$. The collection
$\{u_{\vec{x}} +|+ \vec{x} \in K\}$ is an open covering of $K$. By
Heine-Borel, we can select a finite set of points $\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2, \dots,
\vec{x}_n$ such that $K$ is covered by $u_{\vec{x}_1} \cup u_{\vec{x}_2} \cup \dots
\cup u_{\vec{x}_n}$. Take $\delta = \min\{\delta_1, \delta_2, \dots, \delta_n\}
> 0$  where $\delta_j$ is the radius of $u_{\vec{x}_j}$ for $j = 1,2,3,\dots,n$.

Let $\vec{p}, \vec{q} \in K$ such that $||+\vec{p} - \vec{q}+|| < \delta$. We
need to prove that $|f(\vec{p}) - f(\vec{q})| < \epsilon$. $\vec{p} \in K \to
\exists + j : \vec{p} \in u_{\vec{x}_j} \to ||+\vec{p} - \vec{x}_j+|| <
\delta_j$. But we know that $||+\vec{p} - \vec{q}+|| < \delta_j$. Now by the
Triangle Inequality, we get:

$$||+\vec{q} - \vec{x}_j+|| \leq ||+\vec{q} - \vec{p}+|| + ||+\vec{p} - \vec{x}_j+||
\leq 2 \delta_{\vec{x}_j}$$

This means that $\vec{q} \in 2u_{\vec{x}_j}$. By the way we picked our $\delta$,
we know that $|f(\vec{q}) - f(\vec{x}_j)| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$. Similarly,
we also have $|f(\vec{p}) - f(\vec{x}_j)| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$. Now if we
apply the triangle inequality again, we get:

$$|f(\vec{p}) - f(\vec{q})| = |f(\vec{p}) - f(\vec{x}_j) + f(\vec{x}_j)- f(\vec{q})|\leq |f(\vec{p}) - f(\vec{x}_j)| + |f(\vec{q}) -
f(\vec{x}_j)| < \epsilon$$

Therefore, $f$ is uniformally continuous over $K$.

\subsection{Connected}

\subsubsection{Definition}
$D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ is said to be connected if $\forall \vec{p},
\vec{q} \in D$, $\exists$ a continuous function $\vec{\gamma}:[a, b] \to
\mathbb{R}^d$ that $\vec{\gamma}(a) = \vec{p}$, $\vec{\gamma}(b) = \vec{q}$,
and $\forall t \in [a, b], \vec{\gamma}(t) \in D$

\subsubsection{Theorem}

Let $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ be connected, $D \neq \emptyset$. Suppose $D =
A \cup B$, where $A$ and $B$ are open. Such that $A \cap B = \emptyset$. Then $A
= \emptyset$ or $B = \emptyset$.

\underline{Proof}:

Assume that $D$ can be broken up into two open, non-empty sets $A$ and $B$ such
that $D = A \cup B$. Because $A \neq \emptyset$, we can pick $\vec{p} \in A$ and
similarly we can pick $\vec{q} \in B$. Clearly, $\vec{p}, \vec{q} \in D$. Since
$D$ is connected, $\exists$ continuous $\vec{\gamma}: [a, b] \to D$ such that
$\vec{\gamma}(a) = \vec{p}$, $\vec{\gamma}(b) = \vec{q}$. Let $S = \{t \in [a,b]
+|+ \vec{\gamma}(t) \in A\}$. We know that $a \in S$, so $S \neq \emptyset$.
Note that $S \leq b$, and since it has a bound, it has a supremum. Let $t_0 =
\sup S$, note that $a \leq t_0 \leq b$. Since $\vec{\gamma}(t_0) \in D$, it is
either in $A$ or in $B$ (since $A \cap B = \emptyset$). Suppose
$\vec{\gamma}(t_0) \in A$. Since $A$ is open, we can draw an open ball
($B_\epsilon$) around $\vec{\gamma}(t_0)$. Now consider $\vec{\gamma}(t_0 +
\delta)$ for some small positive $\delta$. If $\delta$ is small enough, $\delta
\in B_\epsilon \in A$. This is a contradiction, as then it means that $t_0 +
\delta \in S$. This is a contradiction, as then $t_0 \neq \sup S$. A similar
contradiction can be made for the case that $\vec{\gamma}(t_0) \in B$. Therefore
the original assumption was false.

\section{Intermediate Value Theorem}

\subsection{Theorem in $\mathbb{R}$}
If f: [a, b] $\to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous, and $f(a) \neq f(b)$, $\forall y \in (f(a), f(b))$, then $\exists c \in (a, b): f(c) = y.$

\subsubsection{Proof}
Let there exist y, without loss of generality, such that $f(a) < y < f(b)$. Take the set $S = \{x \in [a, b] | f(x) \leq
y\}$. Since $a \in S$, $S \neq \emptyset$, we also know that $S \leq b$. Now
take $c = \sup S$, $a \leq c \leq b$ ($c \in [a, b]$). There are three possible
cases, $f(c)$ is either $> y, < y$, or $= y$.

Consider the case in which $f(c) < y$. If this is the case, then we can chose an
arbitrarily small $\delta > 0$ such that $f(c + delta) < y$. However, then $c +
\delta \in S$. But this causes a contradiction because $c = \sup S$ and there
should not be any element of $S$ that's larger than $c$. Therefore, this case is
impossible.

Now consider the case in which $f(c) > y$. Take some arbitrarily small $u \in
[0, \delta], \delta > 0$ such that $f(c - u) > y$. However, then $c - \delta$ is
therefore an upper bound of the set $S$, we once again reach the same
contradiction.

Therefore, since $c$ exists, $f(c) = y$.

\subsection{Theorem in $\mathbb{R^n}$}

If $f : D \to \mathbb{R}$ where $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ is connected
and continuous. $\forall \vec{p}, \vec{q} \in D$ such that $f(\vec{p}) \neq
f(\vec{q})$ and if $y \in \mathbb{R}$ is between $f(\vec{p})$ and $\vec{q}$,
then $\exists \vec{r} \in D$ such that $f(\vec{r}) = y$.

\subsubsection{Proof}

Without loss of generality, let us assume $f(\vec{p}) < f(\vec{q})$.

Since $D$ is connected, there is some path $\vec{\gamma}(t) = (x(t), y(t)) \in
D$, $a \leq t \leq b$ such that $\vec{\gamma}(a) = \vec{p}$ and $\vec{\gamma}(b)
= \vec{q}$ and is continuous over $[a, b]$. Now we construct $g(t) =
f(\vec{r}(t)) = (f\cdot\vec{r})(t) \in mathbb{R}$. Because $g(t)$ is a
composition of continuous functions, $g(t)$ is also continuous. $g(a) =
f(\vec{\gamma}(a)) = f(\vec{p})$ and $g(b) = f(\vec{\gamma}(b)) = f(\vec{q})$.
Now we see that $g(a) < y < g(b)$. Therefore, by the IVT for single-variable
functions, $\exists+t_0$ such that $g(t_0) = y$. Now we plug $t_0$ into
$\vec{\gamma}$, $\vec{r} = \vec{\gamma}(t_0) \in D$. Then $f(\vec{r}) =
f(\vec{\gamma}(t_0)) = g(t_0) = y$.

\section{Vector Valued Functions}

\subsection{Definition}

$f: D \to \mathbb{R}$, $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ is known as
\underline{real-valued} functions.

$\vec{f}: D \to \mathbb{R}^e$, $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ is known as
\underline{vector-valued/point-valued} functions.

$\vec{f}(\vec{p}) = (f_1{\vec{p}}, f_2{\vec{p}}, \dots, f_e(\vec{p}))$ where
$f_1, f_2, \dots, f_e$ are real-valued and are called the \underline{component
functions} of $f$.

\subsection{Continuity}
$f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^e$ is continuous at $\vec{a} = (a_1, a_2,
a_3, \dots, a_d) \in D$ iff $\forall \epsilon, \exists+\delta > 0 : \forall \vec{x} \in D$:

$$||+\vec{x} - \vec{a}+||_d < \delta \to ||+f(\vec{x}) - f(\vec{a})+||_e <
\epsilon$$

\subsubsection{Component-wise Nature of Continuity}
$f: D \to \mathbb{R}^e$ is continuous at a point $\vec{a} \in D$ iff $f_1,
f_2, \dots, f_e$ are all continuous at $\vec{a}$.

\underline{Proof}:

First fix an $\epsilon$, then by the basic distances bound lemma, we get a
bunch of inequalities:

\begin{align*}
    |f_1(\vec{x}) - f_1(\vec{p})| < \frac{\epsilon}{\sqrt{e}}, &\forall \vec{x} \in D \cap B_{\delta_1}(\vec{p})\\
    |f_2(\vec{x}) - f_2(\vec{p})| < \frac{\epsilon}{\sqrt{e}}, &\forall \vec{x} \in D \cap B_{\delta_2}(\vec{p})\\
    ... \text{ } ... \text{ } & \text{ } ... \text{ }...\\
    |f_e(\vec{x}) - f_e(\vec{p})| < \frac{\epsilon}{\sqrt{e}}, &\forall
    \vec{x} \in D \cap B_{\delta_e}(\vec{p})
\end{align*}

Then let $\delta = \min\{\delta_1, \delta_2, \dots, \delta_e\} > 0$, which must
exist and satisfy all the distance inequalities, specifically $\max_{1 \leq j
\leq e}(|f_j(\vec{x}) - f_j(\vec{p})|)$. Then again, by the basic distance
bounds lemma, we know that $||+\vec{f}(\vec{x}) - \vec{f}(\vec{p})+||_e \leq \max_{1 \leq j
\leq e}(|f_j(\vec{x}) - f_j(\vec{p})|)$. Therefore we get that for any fixed
$\epsilon$, we can find a $\delta$ such that $||+\vec{x} - \vec{p}+||_d <
\delta \to ||+f(\vec{x}) - f(\vec{p})+||_e < \epsilon$

\subsubsection{Composition of Continuous Functions}
If $\vec{f}: D \to E$, where $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, $E
\subseteq \mathbb{R}^e$ and $\vec{g}: E \to \mathbb{R}^k$ are both
continuous on their respective domains. Then $\vec{h} = \vec{g} \circ \vec{f}$
is continuous on $D$

\underline{Proof}:

To prove this, fix $\epsilon > 0$. There's a $\eta > 0$ such that
$\forall \vec{y} \in E \cap B_\eta(\vec{f}(\vec{p}))$, because we know that
$\vec{g}$ is continuous at $\vec{f}(\vec{p})$, we get:

$$||+\vec{g}(\vec{y}) - \vec{g}(\vec{f}(\vec{p}))+|| < \epsilon$$

To guarantee that $\vec{y} = \vec{f}(\vec{x})$ lies within $\eta$ units of
$\vec{f}(\vec{p})$ i.e. $||+\vec{f}(\vec{x}) - \vec{f}(\vec{p})+|| < \eta$, we
can take $\vec{x} \in D \cap B_\delta(\vec{p})$ where $\delta > 0$ corresponding
to $\eta$ [using the continuity of $\vec{f}$ at $\vec{p} \in D$].

Now, as long as $\vec{x} \in D \cap B_\delta(\vec{p})$, we have
$\vec{f}(\vec{x}) \in E \cap B_\eta(\vec{f}(\vec{p}))$. Thus, if we take
$\vec{y} = \vec{f}(\vec{p})$, we get: $||+\vec{g}(\vec{f}(\vec{x})) -
\vec{g}(\vec{f}(\vec{p}))+|| < \epsilon$, or $||+\vec{h}(\vec{x}) -
\vec{h}(\vec{p})+|| < \epsilon$. So $\vec{h}$ is continuous at $\vec{p}$.

\subsection{Compactness Theorem}

\subsubsection{Theorem}

Let $\vec{f} : D \to \mathbb{R}^e$ be a contnuous function, where $D \subseteq
\mathbb{R}^d$ is compact. Then its \textit{range} $\vec{f}(D) := \{f(\vec{p}) +|+
\vec{p} \in D\}$ is also compact. In other words: compactness is preserved under
continuous mappings. Note that this is the generalization of the Extreme Value
Theorem.

\subsubsection{Proof}

To prove this, write $R := f(D)$. We need to show that $R$ is closed and bounded
in $\mathbb{R}^e$. Boundedness is easy. Since each component function $f_j$
of $f$ is real valued, by EVT each component function $f_j$ has an absolute
bound $M_j$, so that $|+f_j(\vec{p})+| \leq M_j$ for all $\vec{p} \in D$. 
Take $M := \max\{M_1, M_2, \dots, M_e\}$. Then for all $\vec{p} \in D$, we have

$$||+\vec{f}(\vec{p})+|| = \sqrt{f_1(\vec{p})^2 + \dots + f_e(\vec{p})^2} \leq
\sqrt{e \times M^2} = M \sqrt{e}$$

This says that the range $R$ lies within the closed ball of radius $M\sqrt{e}$
centered at $\vec{0}$ in $\mathbb{R}^e$. It therefore certainly lies within
some closed cube centered at $\vec{0}$, and hence is bounded.

To prove closedness, let $(\vec{y}_n)_{n = 1}^\infty$ be a convergent sequence in
$\mathbb{R}^e$ with limit $\vec{y}$, such that $\vec{y}_n \in R$ for each $n
\geq 1$. We need to prove that $\vec{y} \in R$. Since $R$ is the range of $f$,
we must have $\vec{y} = \vec{f}(\vec{x_n})$, where $\vec{x_n} \in D$. Because
$D$ is bounded, we can pick a convergent subsequence $\vec{x}_{n_k} \to
\vec{x}$. But because $D$ is closed, we know that $\vec{x} \in D$. Because
$\vec{f}$ is continuous, we get that $\vec{y}_{n_k} = \vec{f}(\vec{x}_{n_k}) \to
\vec{f}(\vec{x})$. However, we know that $\vec{y}_{n_k} \to \vec{y}$. But since
each sequence converges to one point, we know that $\vec{y} = \vec{f}(\vec{x})$,
where $\vec{x} \in D$. Therefore, $\vec{y} \in R$.

Therefore, $R$ is closed and bounded.

\subsection{Connectedness Theorem}

\subsubsection{Theorem}

$\vec{f}: D \to \mathbb{R}^e$, $D \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is continuous on $D$.
If $D$ is connected, $E = \vec{f}(D)$ (the range of the domain), is also
connected. Note that this is the generalization of the Intermediate Value
Theorem.

\subsubsection{Proof}

$\forall \vec{u}, \vec{v} \in E$, we can find two points $\vec{p}, \vec{q}$ such
that $\vec{f}(\vec{p}) = \vec{u}$ and $\vec{f}(\vec{q}) = \vec{v}$. Now because
$D$ is connected, $\exists+ \vec{\gamma}: [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^d$,
$\vec{\gamma}([a, b]) \subseteq D$. Now we consider $\vec{\delta} =
\vec{f}(\vec{\gamma}(t))$, $\vec{\delta} : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^e$. Since
it's a composition of continuous functions, $\vec{\delta}$ is also continuous.
And $\forall t \in [a, b]$, $\vec{\delta}(t) = \vec{f}(\vec{\gamma}(t)) \in E$.
We also know that $\vec{\delta}(a) = \vec{f}(\vec{\gamma}(a)) = \vec{f}(\vec{p})
= \vec{u}$, and $\vec{\delta}(b) = \vec{f}(\vec{\gamma}(b)) = \vec{f}(\vec{q})
= \vec{v}$. Therefore, $\forall \vec{u}, \vec{v} \in E$, there is a
continuous path that connects $\vec{u}$ to $\vec{v}$ and stays within $E$.
Therefore, $E$ is connected.

\section{Sequences of Functions}
\subsection{Infinity Norm}
For $f: [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ that is bounded, we say:

$$||f||_\infty := ||f||_D := \sup_{x\in[a,b]} |f(x)|$$

\subsection{Pointwise Convergence:}

\underline{Definition:}
For $f_n : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ for $n \geq 1$, and assume that they are all bounded on $[a,b]$. ($\exists+ M_n > 0 : |f_n(x)| \leq M_n$ for all $x \in [a,b]$), and $f:[a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, $f$ is bounded ($\exists+ M > 0: |f(x)| \leq M$ for all $x \in [a,b]$).

If $\forall x \in [a,b]: \lim_{n\to\infty} f_n(x) = f(x)$, then we say that $f_n \overset{p}{\to} f(x)$ ($f_n$ converges ``pointwise'' to $f$).

\underline{Theorem:}
If $\vec{f_n} \overset{u \text{(uniform)}}{\to} \vec{f}: \mathbb{R^d} \to \mathbb{R^e}$, then $\vec{f_n} \overset{p \text{(pointwise)}}{\to} \vec{f}$ on D: $\vec{f_n}(\vec{x}) \to \vec{f}(\vec{x})$ for every point $\vec{x} \in D$ (for any converging sequences, any point will also converge similarly, such that uniform convergence implies pointwise convergence, though the converse is untrue)

\underline{Proof:}
$\vec{f_n} \overset{u}{\to} \vec{f}$ on D (uniform convergence): $||\vec{f_n} - \vec{f}||_D = sup_{\vec{x} \in D} ||\vec{f_n}(\vec{x}) - \vec{f}(\vec{x})|| \to 0$ as $n \to \infty.$ $Then 0 \leq ||\vec{f_n}(\vec{x}) - \vec{f}(\vec{x})|| \leq  ||\vec{f_n} - \vec{f}|| \to 0.$

Then, by the squeeze theorem, for a uniform sequences, $f_n(x) \to f(x)$ on D, giving pointwise convergence.

\subsection{Uniform Convergence}
\subsubsection{In $\mathbb{R}$}
$f_n : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ for $n \geq 1$, and assume that they are all
bounded on $[a,b]$. ($\exists+ M_n > 0 : |f_n(x)| \leq M_n$ for all $x \in
[a,b]$).

$f:[a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$, $f$ is bounded ($\exists+ M > 0: |f(x)| \leq M$
for all $x \in [a,b]$).

We then claim that $f_n \overset{u}{\to} f$ as $n \to \infty$ if $\forall
\epsilon$, $\exists+ N_\epsilon$ such that $\forall n \geq
N_\epsilon : ||+f_n - f+||_\infty < \epsilon$. In other words, this
forces that the greatest vertical difference between the two functions will be
arbitrarily small after $N_\epsilon$. This forces the two functions to be
``close'' as a whole.

\subsubsection{In $\mathbb{R^n}$}

Let $D \in \mathbb{R}^d$ be a non-empty set, and let $\vec{f}:
D\to\mathbb{R}^e$ and $\vec{f}_n: D \to \mathbb{R}^e$ for $n \geq 1$. We
say that $\vec{f_n} - \vec{f}$ on $D$ if:

$$||+f_n - f+||_D \to 0 \text{ as } n \to \infty$$

\subsection{Uniform Convergence Theorem}
\subsubsection{Theorem}
If $f_n \overset{u}{\to} f$ on $[a, b]$, where each $f_n$ is continuous on
$[a,b]$. Then $f$ is also continuous on $[a,b]$

\subsubsection{Proof}
Pick any $\vec{p} \in D$, and fix $\epsilon > 0$. We need to find $\delta$
such that $\forall \vec{x} \in D$ with $||\vec{x} - \vec{p}|| < \delta$,
then $||\vec{f}(\vec{x}) - \vec{f}(\vec{p})|| < \epsilon$. 
We can apply the triangle inequality and we get:

$$||\vec{f}(\vec{p}) - \vec{f}(\vec{p})|| \leq ||\vec{f}(\vec{x}) 
\vec{f}_n(\vec{x})|| + ||\vec{f}_n(\vec{x}) - \vec{f}_n(\vec{p})|| +
||\vec{f}_n(\vec{p}) - \vec{f}(\vec{p})||$$

For large enough $n$, we know that $||\vec{f}_n - \vec{f}||_D < \frac{\epsilon}{3}$
because $\vec{f}_n - \vec{f}$. Now we know that the first and third ter
are bounded by $\frac{\epsilon}{3}$. The second term is bounded b
$\frac{\epsilon}{3}$ because $\vec{f}_n$ is uniformally continuous.

Therefore, we know that $||\vec{f}(\vec{p}) - \vec{f}(\vec{p})|| \le
\epsilon$ for any $\delta$ we pick. $\therefore \vec{f}$ is continuous on $D$
