End of MVT Proof:

$q_t = (1 -t)\vec{p} + t\vec{q}$ for $t \in (-r, 1+r), r > 0$, such that $\frac{d}{dt}\vec{q}_t = \vec{q} - \vec{p}$

Using the second to last fraction, if $0 \in S$, then $S \neq \emptyset$

$S \leq 1, T := sup(S)$ exists and $0 \leq T \leq 1$. $T \in S$, such that by continutity, $\vec{f}(\vec{q}_{t_n}) \to \vec{f}(\vec{q}_T)$, such that the limit of each side of the inequality exists
