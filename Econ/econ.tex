\section{Module 1}
\subsection{Comparative Advantage and Trade}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Trade is the division of tasks, such that people trade goods and services for those they want
\begin{enumerate}
\item Gains from trade are caused by specialization, due to engaging in a specific task allowing the production of more of the good
\item This is due to the time required for skill development in a field
\item This also results from comparative advantage, or the idea that some people are better at certain actions than others, resulting in a lower opportunity cost for production
\item People will only accept deals that cost less than their personal opportunity cost for production
\end{enumerate}
\item Absolute advantage is the general ability to produce more, under any relative distribution of resources
\begin{enumerate}
\item Comparative advantage creates the mutual benefits of trade, not absolute advantage
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
