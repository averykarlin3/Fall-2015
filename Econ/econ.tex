\section{International Trade and Finance}

\subsection{Capital Flows and the Balance of Payment}
\begin{enumerate}
\item International transactions are monitored and summerized similarly to the national income and product accounts, by balance of payment accounts
\begin{enumerate}
\item The accounts monitor products, interest, loans, and deposits both entering and leaving the country, and the net values for each, split into several catagories
\item The first is the balance of payments on the current account (current account), made up of transactions that don't create liabilities, or sales of products, factor income to and from foreigners, and monetary transfers
\item The second is the financial/capital account made up of transactions which create a liability, including official (government) asset transactions and private asset transactions
\item The trade balance is the balance of payments on goods, rather than both goods and services, used due to being quicker to measure
\end{enumerate}
\item The total net account must equal 0, such that any surplus/deficit is an issue with the data, since it refers to the flow of funds, such that money that is spent must be gained, similar to circular flow
\item The financial account is a measure of capital inflows, or financial capital (available currency) for investment spending entering the country, measured by the loanable funds model
\begin{enumerate}
\item It is simplified by assuming all assets are in the form of loans, although there are other assets and foreign direct investment (companies purchasing capital abroad), and by ignoring expected exchange rate changes
\item Assuming foreign loans are considered equal to domestic and ignoring public/official loans, the interest rate will move towards an equal point, with the gap filled by capital inflow/outflow
\end{enumerate}
\item Different countries have different loanables funds equilibriums on their own, due to different investment opportunities, generally more available in rapidly growing economies, such as the US at the start of the 20th century by industrialization and expansion
\begin{enumerate}
\item Differences in loanable funds supplied are based on the private savings rate (MPS) and government budget balance
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
