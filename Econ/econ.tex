\section{International Trade and Finance}

\subsection{Capital Flows and the Balance of Payment}
\begin{enumerate}
\item International transactions are monitored and summerized similarly to the national income and product accounts, by balance of payment accounts
\begin{enumerate}
\item The accounts monitor products, interest, loans, and deposits both entering and leaving the country, and the net values for each, split into several catagories
\item The first is the balance of payments on the current account (current account), made up of transactions that don't create liabilities, or sales of products, factor income to and from foreigners, and monetary transfers
\item The second is the financial/capital account made up of transactions which create a liability, including official (government) asset transactions and private asset transactions
\item The trade balance is the balance of payments on goods, rather than both goods and services, used due to being quicker to measure
\end{enumerate}
\item The total net account must equal 0, such that any surplus/deficit is an issue with the data, since it refers to the flow of funds, such that money that is spent must be gained, similar to circular flow
\item The financial account is a measure of capital inflows, or financial capital (available currency) for investment spending entering the country, measured by the loanable funds model
\begin{enumerate}
\item It is simplified by assuming all assets are in the form of loans, although there are other assets and foreign direct investment (companies purchasing capital abroad), and by ignoring expected exchange rate changes
\item Assuming foreign loans are considered equal to domestic and ignoring public/official loans, the interest rate will move towards an equal point, with the gap filled by capital inflow/outflow
\end{enumerate}
\item Different countries have different loanables funds equilibriums on their own, due to different investment opportunities, generally more available in rapidly growing economies, such as the US at the start of the 20th century by industrialization and expansion
\begin{enumerate}
\item Differences in loanable funds supplied are based on the private savings rate (MPS) and government budget balance
\end{enumerate}
\item Realistically, there are gross flows in both directions due to interest rates not being the only factor
\begin{enumerate}
\item This can include diversifying portfolios or creating international factories to sell more products in those regions
\item International banking centers such as the US, also create investment in the US, whose firms invest overseas
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Foreign Exchange Market}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Products from a country must be purchased in that country's currency, such that the foreign exchange market determines the exchange rate for currencies
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the currency becomes more valuable, it appreciates, or depreciates if the opposite, based on supply and demand in the market, with exchange rate to a foreign currency as the y-axis, and quantity of domestic on the x-axis
\item This is based on the fact that as the exchange rate rises, such that more foreign dollars are gained, foreign products seem cheaper, such that demand of US products goes down, and supply up
\end{enumerate}
\item As a result, the amount of US products and assets purchased equals the amount of foreign products and assets purchased, though the percentage of each may differ, such that equilibrium preserves it
\item Due to differences in the rate of inflation, $\text{Real exchange rate} = \text{Nominal exchange rate} * \frac{\text{Price level}_1}{\text{Price level}_2$, where the exhange rate is the amount of currency 2 per currency 1
\begin{enumerate}
\item As a result, current accounts respond only to changes in the real exchange rate, not nominal, such that neither does the balance
\end{enumerate}
\item Purchasing power parity is the nominal exchange rate for which the same market basket would cost the same amount in both countries
\begin{enumerate}
\item
